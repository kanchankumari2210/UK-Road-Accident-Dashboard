# UK-Road-Accident-Dashboard
As a data analyst, I have developed a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to analyze and present UK road accident statistics, aiming to inform stakeholders and improve road safety. This dashboard leverages the power of Excel's advanced features, including pivot tables and slicers, to provide visually engaging and meaningful insights.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Fatalities, Serious Injuries, and Slight Injuries: Track trends in casualties across these severity levels, enabling quick identification of areas needing focused interventions.
Monthly Trend Comparison: Visually compare current and previous year's casualties monthly, revealing seasonal patterns and potential areas for improvement.
Interactive Exploration:

Casulties by Road Surface: Utilize a tree map to explore how different road surfaces (e.g., asphalt, gravel) contribute to casualties. This interactive visualization allows for drilling down into specific surface types for deeper analysis.
Casulties by Road Condition and Light: Gain insights into the interplay between road conditions (e.g., wet, icy) and lighting (daytime, nighttime) and their impact on casualties. A donut chart effectively summarizes this relationship.
